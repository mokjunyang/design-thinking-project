# DESIGN THINKING PROJECT (AI-ASSISTED TRAVEL APPLICATION)

Our theme for the project was "Big Data and Artificial Intelligence". Based on this theme, we began brainstorming ideas revolving this theme. In the end, we came up with the idea of an AI-assisted travel application that uses predictive AI to give our users a general idea of the weather on a given day so that they can prepare in advance.

<h3><ins>Reflections on Design Thinking Project</ins></h3>
<h3>What is your goal/dream with regard to your course/program?</h3>
My goal with regards to this course is to improve upon my programming skills and enhance my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I believe there is a lot to learn apart from the skills stated above that will help me in life in terms of mathematical prowess, technical proficiency, creative thinking and countless others. My dream when I have reached the end of this program is to be sufficiently equipped with skills to become a game developer. I want to be able to make visually appealing games that can both attract and inspire players.

<h3>How does this design thinking impact on your goal/dream with regard to your program?</h3>
This project allowed me to think creatively about any given theme (in this case, about big data and artificial intelligence). It also fostered collaboration within our group as we discussed various ideas that we could incorporate into our designs. By honing my creativity and teamwork skills in this project, I can say that it has helped me in my path of creating interesting games and also gave me a general idea of collaborating with others to make something.

<h3>What is the action/improvement/plan necessary for you to improve your potential in the industry?</h3>
Computer science is a tough subject that requires a lot of discipline and hard work for someone to achieve desirable results. As such, I need to get my hands dirty and code as often as I can. Apart from that, I want to partake in events that allow me to work on projects that will both improve my skills as a programmer as well as to be listed as achievements that I can show to future employers in my resume. Following that, I also want to learn softwares such as Blender and Unreal Engine.
